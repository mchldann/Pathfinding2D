# Pathfinding 2D

A basic 2D pathfinding example in Unity that illustrates how to calculate blocked/free grid squares and refresh the path via threading.

Adapted from [https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding-2D](https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding-2D).

Note that there is no path smoothing, and the birds do *not* follow the returned paths via steering forces.
